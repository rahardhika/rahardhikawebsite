  title : "ABOUT ME"
  content : "I am a PhD candidate in the Sociology Department at Northwestern University. I am also an Arryman Scholar at the Equality Development and Globalization Studies at Northwestern. My current research explains the variation of development among agrarian economies of Southeast Asia. I am interested in examining historical factors that transform and sustain agrarian society by tracing domestic and international forces from colonial to contemporary periods that significantly shaped the institutional development around economic transformation in Southeast Asia. For my dissertation project, Embedded Peasantry: Diverging Paths in Southeast Asia Rubber Economies, I use the case of natural rubber plantation and manufacturing industries to examine the bifurcation of development among historically prominent rubber producing countries. I employ a comparative historical framework to analyze evidence collected through archival study, interviews, and ethnographic fieldworks in rubber communities across Southeast Asia."

      company : "Comparative Historical Sociology of Natural Rubber and Paths of Development in Southeast Asia"
      content : "Despite sharing many commonalities with Indonesia, Malaysia has managed to transform into an industrialized economy faster and more successfully. What explains this variation? I argue that the answer lies in how the state reacted to the peasants' orientation toward communist movement in the post-colonial state-building period of 1945 to 1966 amidst the Cold War geopolitics in the two countries. The different anti-communist orientations forged a divergent path of the agrarian political relations in the two neighboring countries: the embedded peasantry in Malaysia and the dis-embedded peasantry in Indonesia "

      content : "Analyzing changes in power and appearance of public space several towns in Southeast Asia, this paper shows the production and utilization of colors as cultural objects in electoral politics. I elaborate on how political actors produce color as an aesthetic object to obtain and maintain power. Three conditions foster the durability of color in emerging democracies: weakened citizens’ collective identity, rejuvenated bureaucrats’ collective memory on authoritarian political color, and augmented authority in the context of decentralized democracy. This research demonstrates the utilization of color as a cultural object to expand and maintain electoral and bureaucratic power."

      company : "Mechanism of Corruption in Decentralized Deemocracies"
      content : "The transition to democracy generates more opportunities for local government officials to misuse public funds for their political interests through bureaucratic clientelism as a mechanism of corruption. It is a phenomenon of exchange based on clientelistic links in which political leaders, per informal rules, induce bureaucrats to misuse public funds for their interest to win elections. This research conceptualizes bureaucratic clientelism and applies the concept to understand the corruption trend in Indonesia using a case study qualitative analysis. Through this mechanism, corruption is deepening after democratization, particularly following a decentralization reform."

  title : "BOOK PROJECT"
  content : "My book project aims to contest, refine, and organize existing theories of economic transformation among late developing countries in the Global South, particularly in Southeast Asia. It addresses the variety of development in agrarian economies that sustained a significant agricultural burden before underwent industrialization. Despite having to deal with a large agricultural sector at the onset of post-colonial state-building, why did some countries succeed in transforming their economy while others did not? The book also proposes an innovative solution to the problem of an unsustainable path to economic development. This problem leads not only to environmental degradation but also to three conditions that perpetuate poverty in the Global South: rising inequality, the expansion of a vulnerable urban informal sector, and the endurance of an inefficient agriculture economy. What path of economic transformation should countries in the Global South take to achieve a higher economic level without necessarily following the unsustainable development blueprint of their counterparts in the North? I demonstrate that political relations between the state and peasantry class molded the path of economic transformation that has resulted in the discrepancy in levels of development, environmental sustainability, and social protection. The arguments in this book contribute to the debate on institutional explanations of development in the fields of sociology of development, political economy, and economic history. For this project, I conducted extensive archival research at 20 libraries and archive centers in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Netherlands, the United States, and the United Kingdom. I also gathered oral history, interviews, and observations from multi-sited ethnography fieldwork in multiple rubber communities Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Myanmar."
